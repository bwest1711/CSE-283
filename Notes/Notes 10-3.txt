	- Specifically the sections in the syllabus
	- And programming problems

Solutions for lab 1-4 are posted
	
Chapter 1

	- Be able to explain circuit switching v. packet switching
		- Why?
	- 4 types of delays
		- identify
			- Processing
			- Queueing
			- Transmission
				- How quickly you can write bytes to a channel
			- Propagation
				- Distance being sent
	- network -> application
		- protocol layers (IP)
		- where in the stack do applications fit
	- Why protocols are so useful

Chapter 2
	- Application protocols(HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS)
		- Be able to explain each does
		- What the are based on (TCP or UDP)

			- One computer v. widely distributed
	- Client server architecture v. p2p
		- being able to identify the differences
		- who initiates the connection
	- UDP and TCP
		- User datagram packets
		- Transmission

Chapter 3
	- UDP and TCP
		- The book covers TCP well
		- Understand how to program in both UDP and TCP
			- Understand how TCP handles reliable data transfer
	- Reliable data transfer
		- Sequence numbers v. acknowledgements

Programming
	- Labs 1-4 are fair
		- Not specifically about the lab
			- More about the structure
			- Be able to explain what is happening
		- Shown code, can we finish it/ can we find bugs
		- Know what is a blocking call
		- InetAddress
			- What is it?
			- How does it use DNS?
	Lab 2
		- Packet loss
			- How we dealt with it.
	Lab 3
		- out.println() == out.print() + out.print("\n") + out.flush()
			- flushes the output stream
		- in.readLine()
			- blocking call
	Lab 4
		- Things got interesting
		- High level multi threading
			- Why we care about it.
